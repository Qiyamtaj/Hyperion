This task is a constumised task manager where we are required to meet the specifications of our ficticoius client Poised. 
We have also learnt Unified Modeling Langiage (UML) for this task as we understand the importance of being able to create diagrams which can show the way a programme
would work that can be understoond by non-coders.
Having a client gives us the ability to create very specific functions for the client needs.
We have used a object orietend programme for this.
