This task is a customized task manager where we are required to meet the specifications of our fictitious client Poised. 
We have also learnt Unified Modeling Language (UML) for this task as we understand the importance of being able to create diagrams which can show the way a programme
would work that can be understood by non-coders.
Having a client gives us the ability to create very specific functions for the client's needs.
We have used an object oriented programme for this.
