In this project we were tasked with creating a task manager for a small business, that would perform various tasks such as:
- Registering a new user to a txt file which is used to store usernames and passwords
- Adding a task to a txt file that stores all task data
- Generate reports using task information, these reports generates:
  - percent of incomplete tasks 
  - percent of overdue tasks 
  - total tasks
  - incomplete tasks 
  - complete tasks 
- View my own tasks ( this will display tasks assigned to user using their username to find these tasks in the txt file )
- View all tasks
- View statistics ( this will display the report generated )
- Exit (this will exit the while loop)
There are two different menu options based on admin privileges
